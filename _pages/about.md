Hi! I am Qitao Tan. I am currently a Ph.D. student in Department of Computer Science at the University of Pittsburgh, advised by Dr. Xulong Tang. I received my B.E. degree in Software Engineering from Sichuan University, China, in 2020. My research focuses on designing and optimizing efficient machine learning algorithms and systems, spanning applications in diffusion-based video generation, self-supervised contrastive learning, and supervised model training. I also work on 3D-related algorithms and systems, such as efficient 3D Gaussian Splatting. My research targets diverse platforms, ranging from powerful cloud clusters to resource-constrained edge devices.
