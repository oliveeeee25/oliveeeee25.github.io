Hi, this is Xiaoying Song, a Ph.D. student in Department of information Science at the University of North Texas, advised by [Dr. Lingzi Hong.](https://lingzihong.github.io/index.html) Pior to that, I received my M.S. degree in information science from Central China Normal University, China, in 2023. My research focuses on human-centered computing at the intersection of NLP and computational social science. I study how LLMs interact with humans to ensure effectiveness, safety, and equity. Besides, I also explore how LLMs can incorporate time, location, and sequential human behavioral data to better understand evolving events and to generate responses that are timely, context-aware, and aligned with human needs.
